Requirements:
  Python3

Before use:
Extract all contents from ovo.tar.gz. 

To run:
Locate the file 'ovo.py' in a shell (or pass the full path to python) and type the following:
  python3 ovo.py cost <POWER_USAGE> <GAS_USAGE>

  or

  python3 ovo.py usage <TARIFF_NAME> <FUEL_TYPE> <TARGET_MONTHLY_SPEND>

After the first command is execute, the program goes into a REPL and will prompt for new commands
until you type 'quit'. There is some basic error handling in the REPL and the module itself,
but for brevity's sake I've not covered every possible invalid input or error.
